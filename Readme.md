### Motivation:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
    <p>
Our team shares a mutual interest in small businesses because of our involvement with them. Inventory tracking and order planning is one of the key parts of a successful business and can become complicated without proper tracking. By creating a tool that can help simplify the inventory and order planning we enable ourselves to achieve success by simplifying these processes. Inventory is also used in a variety of industries so our product can be relevant to a wide range of audiences - retail stores, restaurants, etc.. The inventory system covers a few concepts each of us want to learn and is applicable to the class, including html webpage design and interacting with databases. We believe there will be a middleware requirement, to keep the database secure and allow authentication for customers. 
    </p>
    <p>
There are several moving parts to the system, such as the database, 2 frontends (can be combined, but attention is needed) and middleware/backend. We want to create a useful project that is both challenging
    </p>
    <p>
We will also have the opportunity to move through the phases of project planning, collaboration, and general agile development strategies.

### Risks to Project Completion:

1. A large number of possible features could lead to snowballing task numbers.  
2. Limited timeframe, needs to be completed by the end of the semester.  
3. Lack of previous knowledge, first time building an inventory management system.  
4. Potential time constraints, jobs, other classes.  
5. Lack of experience in SQL implementation.  

### Mitigation Strategy for Above Risks:  

1. Clear direction and agreement on included features.  
2. Sprints have clear objectives and deadlines are met.  
3. Research and sharing knowledge in team meetings.  
4. Adapting to the plan as needed to ensure quality over quantity.  
5. Research and group problem resolution.

### Development method:
We are planning to follow the Agile methodology with weekly “standup” meetings via Zoom which correspond to our one week sprints.


The proposal will be used to ensure we have clear goals which meet product owner specifications. From there, we will refine the customer stories and use it to play agile poker. Once the tasks are assigned to group members, we will update the trello board and review our timeline for creation within the context of this class.  This way, we can adjust our project to ensure delivery of a MVP within provided guidelines to create a sprint schedule. We will consistently assess the goals and reality of our project and adjust tasks accordingly.
