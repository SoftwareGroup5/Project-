# Readme for Group \#5

## Development method:
We are planning to follow the Agile methodology with weekly “standup” meetings via Zoom which correspond to our one week sprints.


The proposal will be used to ensure we have clear goals which meet product owner specifications. From there, we will refine the customer stories and use it to play agile poker. Once the tasks are assigned to group members, we will update the trello board and review our timeline for creation within the context of this class.  This way, we can adjust our project to ensure delivery of a MVP within provided guidelines to create a sprint schedule. We will consistently assess the goals and reality of our project and adjust tasks accordingly.
