Last week we all generated 3 AI images for our countertops, grouped them into categories, and pushed them to the git repo. In addition to our normal weekly meeting (which we recorded for Milestone 2), we also held a meeting to talk about website layout. We created a powerpoint and Lucid chart to represent our layout. This week we are working on finalizing the details of each page and moving that information into a markdown file for Milestone 4. We also created this document and added this first post for Milestone 3. There are currently no roadblocks in our way.
