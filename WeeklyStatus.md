Last week we all generated 3 AI images for our countertops, grouped them into categories, and pushed them to the git repo. In addition to our normal weekly meeting (which we recorded for Milestone 2), we also held a meeting to talk about website layout. We created a powerpoint and Lucid chart to represent our layout. This week we are working on finalizing the details of each page and moving that information into a markdown file for Milestone 4. We also created this document and added this first post for Milestone 3. There are currently no roadblocks in our way.

Last week we submitted Milestone 3 with our first weekly status report. We also worked on transferring the layout we designed together on PPT over to the official Web_Layout.md for Milestone 4. Each team member was responsible for transferring an assigned page to the MD file and everyone completed their tasks. The document now contains an image of the overall layout as well as page description, links, parameters, and data for each page. This week we are going to finalize the document by adding in test cases and any final visuals. Each team member is assigned the same sections and test cases as last week - trello has been updated accordingly. In our weekly meeting we also started brainstorming next steps we can take to prepare for actually implementing the website (starting html docs, designing schemas, etc.) and plan to formally assign those tasks next week. All group members attended the meeting and participated. There are currently no roadblocks in our way. 

**Week 9: 3/10/2025**

Last week we added additional information to the PAGE_TESTING.md document for upcoming Milestone 4. This was mostly testing, data, and parameter information. In our weekly meeting we discussed progress, gave each other feedback, and planned final steps to finish this document for the Thursday deadline. We are going to make some small edits over the next two days and then meet on Wednesday to confirm everything aligns and looks accurate before turning in Milestone 4. After completing this step, we will work on listing our variables so that we can come to next week's meeting and match up variable names to minimize confusion later on. All group members attended the meeting and participated. There are currently no roadblocks in our way.

**Week 10: 3/17/2025**

Last week we finalized and submitted Milestone 4. We had a brief meeting last Wednesday to review everyone's contributions before submitting. This week we met and planned out our SQL tables in preparation for Milestone 5 - including table names, attributes,attribute data types, and keys. We did this together on zoom using an excel spreadsheet and everyone participated. Moving forwards, everyone is responsible for one table (see trello) and will add this table to the SQL_TESTING.md doc and write the associated testing. We plan to have this mostly completed when we meet on the 31st and can review, ask questions, and make revisions as needed before the April 3rd deadline. The group does not plan to meet over spring break, but we will be in touch via discord as needed.  

**Week 11: 3/31/2025**

Last week (excluding spring break), we worked on Milestone 5 by adding our respective tables to the SQL_Testing file. 4/5 sections are done so we are just waiting on one final section to be completed this week before the Wednesday deadline. We also reviewed this document in our weekly meeting and determined that we all need to add a more specific function description so that will also happen this week before Wednesday. 4/5 group members attended the meeting so we will fill in the 5th group member via Discord and trello. Our plan for this week is to start writing code. We will all write code to initialize our respective tables and populate with some info to get us started. We confirmed that we will use Render and Flask and will start adding our sql code to our app.py document. If time allows, we will also write some tests to confirm table integrity.
