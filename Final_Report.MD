### Reflection 

What we completed:
  - functional login for client and customer and admin
  - product page showing available products for purchase, can be added to cart
  - profile page custom for admin vs customer: admin shows full inventory + shipping status, customer shows personalalized information + order history 
  - cart shows active cart, calculates total
  - can place real order from cart 

What we were in the middle of implementing: 
  - We finished everything we planned to finish.

What we had planned for the future:
  - abandon cart feature to send automatic email to customer
  - shipping status can be updated from admin portal
  - create account for new users 
  - continued styling and uniformity across pages 
  - handle negative inventory + low stock 

Any known problems (bugs, issues): 
  - database resets every time a user logs in/out (this was intentional for demonstration purposes but on a production level wouldn't make sense)
